          <h3>Tonga says it has been hit by an "unprecedented disaster", in the government's first update since a volcanic eruption triggered a tsunami. </h3>
  
          <p>In a statement, the government confirmed three deaths: two locals and a British national.</p>
  
          <p>It said some of the smaller outlying islands were particularly badly affected, with all the houses destroyed on one and just two left on another.</p>
  
          <p>Aid efforts have been hampered by ash falling from the volcano.</p>
  
          <p>Volunteers have been sweeping the runway of the main airport to allow planes bringing much needed drinking water and supplies to land.</p>
  
          <p>Communications with the island chain have been disrupted after the single underwater cable connecting Tonga to the rest of the world was severed in the eruption.</p>

          <p>In its update, the Tongan government said the internet was down, but some local phone services were available and work was under way to restore full communications.</p>
  
          </hr>
          <p>The statement also said:</p>
  
          <ul>
             <li>A 65-year-old woman, a 49-year-old man<a href="#"> and British woman Angela Glover</a> were killed in the tsunami. A number of injuries have also been reported</li>
             <li>Dozens of houses on the main island of Tongatapu were also damaged</li>
             <li>Evacuations from the worst-hit islands are under way</li>
             <li>Water supplies have been "seriously affected" by the volcanic ash</li>
             <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
             <li>Flights have been temporarily halted and sea transport routes are disrupted </li>
    
          </ul>
       
      
           <p>Such is the damage to communications networks, the World Health Organization said a lone official had been channelling information between UN agencies and the Tongan government using a satellite phone.</p>
  
           <p>Many Tongans abroad have been waiting since Saturday's eruption to hear news from loved ones.</p>
  
           <p>Meanwhile, the UN said it would try to maintain Tonga's Covid-free status when aid starts arriving.</p>
